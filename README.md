# DaBomb 
This is my shameless extension of Mazen Elzanaty's EmBombPlus! (https://github.com/MazenElzanaty/EmBomber.git). This is a very useful script for red teaming, penetration testing, research... I'm running out of ideas... lol. I want to put some additions onto the code without messing up Mazen's git repository. So I will just reflect those changes here, then send them over until or if, when, whatever integration is possible.



# As of this code cloning, this is the original announcement:
## Features
- Support Gmail
- Support Yahoo
- Support Hotmail/Outlook
- SMTP Relay

## Usage
EmBomber should work on all Linux distros running Python 2.7
First, clone it by entering the following command in the terminal
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/MazenElzanaty/EmBomber.git
```
Now navigate to EmBomber directory
``` bash
cd EmBomber
```
Now you can run EmBomber
``` bash
python EmBomber.py
```
## Note
You need to enable less secure apps on Gmail and Yahoo
